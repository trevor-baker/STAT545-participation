- see file cm006-exercise.Rmd for most of the work done today

```{r}
library(gapminder)


#diff of tibble vs df
######################

#print gapminder as tibble - less rows show, shows classes
print(gapminder)

#print gapminder as dataframe - more rows, no info about it
print(as.data.frame(gapminder)) #this needs to be done down in console, not here in Rmd to see the difference

```
