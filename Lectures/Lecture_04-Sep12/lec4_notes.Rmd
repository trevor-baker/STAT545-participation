* clone vs pull
  * clone when you don't have a local copy
  * pull when you do have a local copy


* to link your git account, use Terminal in RStudio, and enter these commands sequentially:
  * git config --global user.name 'Jane Doe'
  * git config --global user.email 'jane@example.com'
  * git config --global --list
  

* if you want to revert to earlier stage of files, i.e. previous commit, then easiest way is to do it online in Github
  * navigate back in commit history, open or download file, take what you need, save it to your current branch
