# Effective Visualizations

Now that you know how to create graphics and visualizations in R, you are armed with powerful tools for scientific computing and analysis. With this power also comes great responsibility. Effective visualizations is an incredibly important aspect of scientific research and communication. There have been several books (see references) written about these principles. In class today we will be going through several case-studies trying to develop some expertise into making effective visualizations. 

## Worksheet

**The worksheet questions for today are embedded into the class notes.**

You can download this Rmd file [here](https://github.com/STAT545-UBC/Classroom/blob/master/cm013.Rmd)

Note, there will be very little coding in-class today, but I've given you plenty of exercises in the form of a supplemental worksheet (linked at the bottom of this page) to practice with after class is over.

## Part 1: Warm-up and pre-test [20 mins]

### Warmup:

Write some notes here about what "effective visualizations" means to you. Think of elements of good graphics and plots that you have seen - what makes them good or bad? Write 3-5 points.

1. clear axis and legend labels, and figure title/caption
2. simplicity in colours and symbols
3. data ordered sensibly
4. 
5.

### CQ01: Weekly hours for full-time employees

> Question: Evaluate the strength of the claim based on the data: "German workers are more motivated and work more hours than workers in other EU nations."
>
> Very strong, strong, weak, very week, do not know

- _Answer:_ Very weak. There are two claims - more motivated and work more; this graph shows nothing of motivation and Germany is not even the highest number of hours. The x-axis is misleading as it starts at about 35 hours, and should start at 0. There is no variation shown (e.g. st.dev). There is no sample size or data source shown.

- Main takeaway: This graph is misleading in several ways and does not support one of the claims in the associated statement.

### CQ02: Average Global Temperature by year

> Question: For the years this temperature data is displayed, is there an appreciable increase in temperature?
> 
> Yes, No, Do not know

- No. Variation is not shown, cannot tell if difference is significant. Zoomed out y-axis makes the trend hard to decipher (not always the best idea to start axis at zero). No labels on x-axis give no idea of time period.

- Main takeaway: Don't blindly follow advice, e.g. start axis at zero, need to use discretion and scientific insight.

### CQ03: Gun deaths in Florida

> Question: Evaluate the strength of the claim based on the data: â€œSoon after this legislation was passed, gun deaths sharply declined."
>
> Very strong, strong, weak, very week, do not know

- _Answer:_ Very weak. The graph actually shows gun deaths went up. It is deceiving because 0 is at the top.

- Main takeaway: Do not reverse axes. Being too creative is bad.

## Part 2: Extracting insight from visualizations  [20 mins]

Great resource for selecting the right plot: https://www.data-to-viz.com/ ; encourage you all to consult it when choosing to visualize data.

### Case Study 1: Context matters

Autism axis goes from zero to max value, but vaccine axis goes from 86% to 95%. Implies that if vaccination rate went below 86%, then there would be no autism. Also, there is nothing to suggest causation even if you could somehow see correlation.

### Case Study 2: A case for pie charts

We will be filling these principles in together as a class

### Make a great plot worse

Instructions: Here is a code chunk that shows an effective visualization. First, copy this code chunk into a new cell. Then, modify it to purposely make this chart "bad" by breaking the principles of effective visualization above. Your final chart still needs to run/compile and it should still produce a plot. 

How many of the principles did you manage to break?

## Plotly demo [10 mins]

Did you know that you can make interactive graphs and plots in R using the plotly library? We will show you a demo of what plotly is and why it's useful, and then you can try converting a static ggplot graph into an interactive plotly graph.

This is a preview of what we'll be doing in STAT 547 - making dynamic and interactive dashboards using R!


```{r plotly}

library(tidyverse)
library(gapminder)
library(plotly)

#make simple graph
p <- ggplot(gapminder, aes(x=gdpPercap, y=lifeExp, colour=continent)) +
      geom_point()

#simple plotly example
p %>% 
  ggplotly()

#more complex plotly
pp <- gapminder %>%
        plot_ly(x = ~gdpPercap,
                y = ~lifeExp,
                color = ~continent,
                
                type = 'scatter',
                mode = 'markers' #could also use lines but isn't useful here
                )

#Sys.setenv("plotly_username" = "trevor_baker")
#Sys.setenv("plotly_api_key" = "myKey") #from website settings
#api_create(pp, filename="my_first_plotly")

```


## Supplemental worksheet (Optional)

You are highly encouraged to the cm013 supplemental exercises worksheet. It is a great guide that will take you through Scales, Colours, and Themes in ggplot. There is also a short guided activity showing you how to make a ggplot interactive using plotly.
