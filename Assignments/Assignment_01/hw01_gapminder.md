This document explores the *gapminder* dataset of historical demographic
data spanning from 1952 to 2007 in five-year intervals.

## Basic dataset overview

The dataset includes the following
    fields/columns:

    ## [1] "country"   "continent" "year"      "lifeExp"   "pop"       "gdpPercap"

Here is a brief summary of the integer and numeric
    columns:

    ##       year         lifeExp           pop               gdpPercap

## GDP trends

While Oceania is the richest continent on average, Kuwait, which is on
the Asian continent, is the richest country overall. In the graph below,
all countries with average income values greater than $50000 have been
labelled. These include Kuwait, Norway, Singapore, and the United
States.

A look at some GDP trends by country over time:

You can see general groupings of GDP and life expectancy by continent in
the graph below. Also, there seems to be an asymptotic relationship
between life expectancy and GDP. Mean life expectancy doesnâ€™t increase
much beyond 80 years, no matter how rich the country.
