This document explores the *gapminder* dataset of historical demographic
data spanning from 1952 to 2007 in five-year intervals.

The dataset includes the following
    fields:

    ## [1] "country"   "continent" "year"      "lifeExp"   "pop"       "gdpPercap"

Here is a brief summary of the integer and numeric
    columns:

    ##       year         lifeExp           pop              gdpPercap

While Europe is the richest continent on average, Kuwait, which is
included in the Asian continent, is the richest country overall. In the
graph below, all countries with average income values greater than
$40000 have been labelled. These include Kuwait, Norway, Singapore, and
the United States.

There seems to be an asymptotic relationship between life expectancy and
GDP. Mean life expectancy doesnâ€™t increase much beyond 80 years, no
matter how rich the country.
