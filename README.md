# STAT545-participation
## Trevor Baker's STAT 545 Participation Repository

This repository holds all of my work from in-class activities during _STAT 545_ lectures during the __Fall 2019__ semester at _UBC_.




### Who am I?
I am an MSc student in Soil Science studying in Dr. Andy Black's [Biometerology and Soil Physics Group](https://biomet.landfood.ubc.ca "My research group"). I am also a Soil Scientist at [Integral Ecology Group](https://www.integralecologygroup.com/ "My company"). My work both professionally and as an MSc student pertains to the relationship between site and soil properties and ecosytem occurrence, paricularly for [mine reclamation](https://www.integralecologygroup.com/projects/predicting-ecosystem-occurrence-for-mine-reclamation "My work").

You can contact me by <tbaker@iegconsulting.com>
